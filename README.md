## 💋 What the heck is Babu Lang?

Babu Lang is a **custom programming language** built with love, chaos, and a recursive descent parser in C++.  
It's inspired by **zero logic**, **emotional instability**, and **sweet nothings whispered at 3AM**.

Why?  
Because **normal languages were too normal**, and C++ said, *“bet.”*

## 🧠 Philosophy

If you're used to:
- Logical syntax
- Predictable behavior
- Meaningful variable names

You're gonna **hate this**.  
But if you enjoy:
- Gaslighting your compiler
- Simping over syntactic sugar
- Debugging existential crises

Welcome to the cult 🫡

## 🔨 Built With

- ☠️ **C++**: because pain is temporary, but segmentation faults are forever
- 🧠 **Recursive Descent Parser**: basically a compiler that reads your code like it’s trying to decode mixed signals
- ❤️ **Delusion**: the primary dependency
